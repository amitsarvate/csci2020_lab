# Midterm Code Part 2 

## How To Run:

To run, please use intelliJ. Click on project that says 'Lab05' and open it.
(I had to use my lab05 as a start project because I was having trouble setting up a new project and didnt want to waste time)

Go to the 'HelloApplication.java' and 
run it by right click on the file and clicking the 'Run' option. 

Here you will be greeted by the main screen and from there you will 
be able to choose which of the 3 custom scenes you would like to explore.
